      <comment>first draft, mostly copied from http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2007/November&amp;oldid=1072591#Technical &quot;Wish List&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">Wikibooks uses the [[MediaWiki]] software, which was developed for [[w:|Wikipedia]]. As such, it's not strictly intended for use in writing textbooks. Here is a technical wish list for Wikibooks to help with some of these shortcomings:

#&quot;Search this book&quot; feature being a special page, not a link to a google search
#Per-book stylesheets (although we could just as easily do that in javascript, it might be nice to have the javascript added to the core MW distribution)
#Book organizational meta-pages. A page where you could specify the layout for a book, and it would then generate an automatic TOC, and automatic forward/backward links, etc. Darklama can probably explain this idea better then I can
#List of books. Like the special page [[Special:Allpages]], but would only list the main page of a book, not all pages.
#A read-only Wikijunior domain (already registered) - a read only storage location for all stable book versions, which could be updated from Wikibooks when necessary
#The GNU Lilypond extension, for music and other types of displays (we've asked many times, and never got them because of technical reasons
#PDF generator (currently hosted on the toolserver, but needs much work)
#An automatic TOC-generator tool. Several people have asked how to create new pages; this would help with that by providing a TOC of redlinks for them to work on, and would also foster greater organization of new books right from the get-go.
#Search by book is a must-have!
#A list of all top-level pages in the mainspace would be great, especially if it can be done dynamically (as opposed to periodically sorting through the database or something).
#Watching pages in bundles (ie per-book watchlists)

----
By priority:
:::So that was basically an endorsement of almost all the proposals you mentioned. If prioritizing is required:
:::#Search by book (should be easy to do)
:::#List of top-level pages in the mainspace (ie books) (should be easy to do)
:::#per-book styles (most important thing to do requiring some work)
:::#''Good'' PDF (and/or print version) generation (requires lots of work, and is probably difficult to do properly)
:::#TOC generator-thing (should be easy to do, but we can function just fine without it)
:::#Read-only (needs lots of discussion before anything else)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2285">[[b:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] uses the [[MediaWiki]] software, which was developed for [[w:|Wikipedia]]. As such, it's not strictly intended for use in writing textbooks. Here is a technical wish list for Wikibooks to help with some of these shortcomings:

#&quot;Search this book&quot; feature being a special page, not a link to a google search
#Per-book stylesheets (although we could just as easily do that in javascript, it might be nice to have the javascript added to the core MW distribution)
#Book organizational meta-pages. A page where you could specify the layout for a book, and it would then generate an automatic TOC, and automatic forward/backward links, etc. [[b:User:Darklama|darklama]] can probably explain this idea better then [[b:User:Whiteknight|I]] can
#List of books. Like the special page [[Special:Allpages]], but would only list the main page of a book, not all pages.
#A read-only Wikijunior domain (already registered) - a read only storage location for all stable book versions, which could be updated from Wikibooks when necessary
#The GNU Lilypond extension, for music and other types of displays (we've asked many times, and never got them because of technical reasons
#PDF generator (currently hosted on the toolserver, but needs much work) [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2007-December/001217.html][http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2007-November/001178.html][http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2007-September/001144.html]
#An automatic TOC-generator tool. Several people have asked how to create new pages; this would help with that by providing a TOC of redlinks for them to work on, and would also foster greater organization of new books right from the get-go.
#Watching pages in bundles (ie per-book watchlists) [[bugzilla:12308]]

----
By priority:
#Search by book (should be easy to do)
#''Good'' PDF (and/or print version) generation (requires lots of work, and is probably difficult to do properly)
#List of top-level pages in the mainspace (ie books) (should be easy to do)
#TOC generator-thing (should be easy to do, but we can function just fine without it)
#per-book styles (most important thing to do requiring some work)
#Read-only or other quality control (needs lots of discussion before anything else)</text>
